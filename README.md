## Steering recommendations
This repo contains code to perform steering on LLM-based recommendations. Currently implemented for Llama with MovieLens and Goodreads as data sources.

Next steps are:
* Refactor code to make it simple to choose different data sources (and LLMs?)
* Include Collaborative Filtering information in the prompt (use cf.ipynb as a starter)
